    <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">A Brief History of the Internet</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system. In order to allow for information to be easily transfer for one computer to another or from one part of the world to another with having to move such a large mass of technolgy they needed the ablity to connect such computers.</p>

    <td><h2 style="font-size:20px">History of the ARPAnet</h2>
    <p2 style="font-size:20px">The Internet has no single inventor. It has evolved over a period of time.The Internet started with the US Government creating a network to communicate messages for the Department of Defense. ARPAnet(Advanced Research Project Agency) was created in 1962 to allow the Department of Defense to be able to communicate if the phone lines were destroyed in an attac. ARPAnet was created to allow researchers in different locations to communicate using a network.One of the benefits of the ARPAnet network is it can route information in more that one path or direction. The network can continue to operate in the event of a military attack or natural disaster.</p2>

    <h3>DARPAâ€™s Interlinking Network</h3>
    <p3 style="font-size: 20px;">In 1973 DARPA created a research program to create a network to allow communication between different machines (computers). The projects aim was to develop a set of protocols(rules) to govern the communication between the machines on a given network or networks over a disparate geographic area. The project was initially called "The InternettingProject". The system of networks that came from this research became known as the Internet. The protocols (rules) that was created as part of this research were the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.</p3></td>
